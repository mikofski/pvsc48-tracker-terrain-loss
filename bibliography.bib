abstract = {Accurate performance prediction of large PV systems with shading is challenging because computational complexity increases with system size. Solar Farmer is a new PV performance model with 3-D shading. Comparing predictions with measurements from the NIST PV test bed we observed a decrease in the annual difference of 17{\%} between module and submodule shading. By varying the resolution of shading from module to cell level, we also determined that 5 points persubmodule, resulting in a 0.5{\%} annual difference, was sufficient to accurately predict performance of shaded systems. Therefore, a balance of accuracy and computational expense was achieved allowing performance predictions of large PV systems with shade.},

abstract = {Closed-form equations of the true-tracking angle, backtracking angle, shaded fraction, and orientation angles of single-axis solar trackers installed on arbitrarily oriented slopes are derived. These slope-aware adjustments are necessary to successfully prevent row to row shading in arrays with nonzero cross-axis slope. A tracker rotation modeling procedure comprising these equations is provided.},
